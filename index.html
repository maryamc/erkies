    <h1>Cheetahs Are Cool</h1>
</br>
<p>Cheetahs are one of the worlds most fastest land mammals alive. They can run at speeds of up to 80 mph. Isnt that insane? Thats how much I usually do on 55 mph highway, because I want to be one with the cheetah.  </p>
</br>
<p>Cheetahs usually chase their prey at half that speed, and go straight for the jugular. They thrive in open grasslands and busy areas in different parts of the Middle East and Africa. There are 5 main subspecies of the Cheetah which are:
    <ul>
        <li>Northwest Africa</li>
        <li>East Africa</li>
        <li>Southern Africa</li>
        <li>Northeast Africa</li>
        <li>North Africa to Central India</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</br>
<p>Unfortunately though, today cheetahs are running towards extinction and becoming endangered due to their loss of habitat, lack of prey, and vile human poachers. </p>
